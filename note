(done?) need to slicken the ui using TKC 
(done) like a scroll bar if the number of searches gets too large, maybe a clear all button with a confirmation menu
(done) fix the intro message (it doesnt display)
(done) add a nuke or factory reset button somewhere
(done) add settings? themes? maybe don't need to go that  far....
(done) add a quit button to the menubar
(done) repopulate file dialog when new pdf is added

(done) make it so that the frame sticks to the bottom when new entries are added AND the view is already at the bottom (by modifying handle_enter_query(...))
(done?) go through the GUI code and make it so that any code that deletes and regenerates a frame instead modifies the frame's contents using insert / remove (at) commands when applicable. 


need to rewrite the readme
need to post the package
